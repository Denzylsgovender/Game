# Game Script Manager

## 📘 Overview

In this task, you are challenged to design and implement a program that manages a **disordered game script** using a **Linked List** data structure. The goal is to sort and display a **story-driven script**, allowing users to view it in two distinct ways: as a complete story or one line at a time.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

Through this task, you will:

- Implement and work with **Linked Lists** in C#
- Use a **sorting algorithm** to reorder linked list nodes
- Develop a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** in Android (C# Xamarin or preferred tech)
- Create intuitive **user interaction features**

---

## 🛠️ Task Instructions

### 1. ✅ Implement a Linked List
- Create a `Node` class or structure to store:
  - **Story number** (int)
  - **Story text** (string)
- Create a `LinkedList` class that holds and manages nodes.

### 2. 📝 Populate the Linked List
- Create a function that adds each unordered script paragraph into the list.
- Each node represents one story paragraph, paired with its number.

### 3. 🔁 Sort the Linked List
- Implement a sorting algorithm (Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, etc.)
- Sort based on the **story number** to reorder the script correctly.

### 4. 🖼️ Build the GUI
Build a user interface with the following:
- 🪄 **Display Area 1**: Full sorted game script (all paragraphs combined)
- 📜 **Display Area 2**: One line at a time display
- ▶️ **"Next"** and ⏮️ **"Previous"** buttons to navigate the script line-by-line

### 5. 💡 Display the Sorted Script
- On load or button click, show the **sorted game script** in both display modes.
- Allow the user to scroll through the story or navigate line by line.

### 6. 🔄 Interaction Features
- Allow users to **switch** between:
  - Full script view
  - One-line navigation mode
- Maintain smooth transitions between modes.
